## Pull Shark (GitHub Achievement)

The Pull Shark achievement is earned by getting pull requests **merged**.

### What to do

- Create a small PR (1–2 files) with a clear title.
- Get it merged into the default branch (`main`).
- Repeat with more PRs over time (more merged PRs = more progress).

### Tips for “easy-to-merge” PRs

- Keep changes small and focused (docs-only PRs are great).
- Use a descriptive title (e.g., “Add X docs”, “Fix typo”, “Add roadmap file”).
- Add a short PR description explaining the change and why it’s useful.
